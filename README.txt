To access the Unity project, download Unity Hub, and using it, install the Unity editor version 2022.3.6f1.
After installing the version, go to the Projects tab, select Open>>Add project from disk. When prompted to choose a folder, select the CSCI-3037-Game-master folder to import the project into Unity.
To play the game, either open the editor and press Play Mode at the top of the editor, or run the built application located in CSCI-3037-Game-master/Build.

If running via Unity's editor, find the MainMenu01 Unity scene and open it BEFORE entering Play Mode.
Since the built program lacks an exit button, use the Windows button to summon the taskbar and close the application that way.
